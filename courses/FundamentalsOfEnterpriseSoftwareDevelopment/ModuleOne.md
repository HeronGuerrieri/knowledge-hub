# Tech Leads Club - Enterprise Software Development Fundamentals
## Module 1 Notes

This first module set the stage for building a complete, production-grade system from end to end. The goal is to deliver something with strong automated tests, a robust and maintainable architecture, and the ability to scale.

We covered high-level summaries of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Hexagonal Architecture**, and **Clean Architecture**, to help shape clear boundaries and responsibilities in the code. These concepts guide us in designing software thatâ€™s easy to evolve and test.

We also scaffolded the basic project structure. While the course example uses **TypeScript with NestJS, Prisma, and Postgres**, I'm implementing it with **.NET 9, Entity Framework, and SQL Server**. The focus so far has been on setting up folders, dependencies, and initial layers in a way that supports the architectural principles discussed.
